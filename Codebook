This script prepares the Smartphone Human Activity Data for further analysis
The raw data needs to be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/

The summary data is found at the file SummaryActivityMeasurements.txt

This is a preview of the head of the file:

    "subject" "activityname" "measure" "average"
    "1" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" -0.9390990524
    "2" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" -0.86706520518
    "3" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" -0.8826668762
    "4" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" -0.9244374346
    "5" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" -0.8336255561


The file has the folowing attributes:

# of the row. Example "1", "2", etc.
subject - Human that perform the test or training. Represented by a number such as 1, 2, 3, etc...I guess for privacy
activityname - Type of activity. There are 6 types of activities measured:
      LAYING 
      SITTING 
      STANDING 
      WALKING 
      WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
      WALKING_UPSTAIRS
measure - This is a list of all the measurements recorded. There are 561 measurements recorded. Here are some examples:
    tBodyAcc-mean()-X 
    tBodyAcc-mean()-Y 
    tBodyAcc-mean()-Z 
    tBodyAcc-std()-X  
    tBodyAcc-std()-Y 
    tBodyAcc-std()-Z  
average - This is the calculated mean for each measurement recorded organized by activity type and human subject

So how should we interpreted this data, let's take the first few calculations:
subject" "activityname" "measure" "average"
    "1" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" -0.9390990524
    "2" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" -0.86706520518
    "3" 1 "LAYING" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" -0.8826668762
    
They are telling us that Subject 1 (let's call him John), while Laying, the average values of the Body Accelerometer are
for X = -0.9390990524, Y = -0.86706520518, Z = -0.88266687623
wow, I wander how they compare with my fitbit!
